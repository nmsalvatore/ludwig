        <p>Welcome to the Ludwig user dashboard! Since this project is very much a work in progress, there's not much here right now. For the moment, you can start a dialogue by clicking the relevent button below. Additionally, you'll see a list of dialogues that you're participating in. Currently, these dialogues are sorted by most recent activity. I think that's it for now.</p>
        <p>Thanks for joining and I hope you enjoy your time here!</p>
