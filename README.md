# Ludwig

Ludwig is an online space built to facilitate long-form public conversations. The application is built with Django, HTMX, and PostgreSQL and offers real-time updates to keep the conversation flowing smoothly. Conversations are closed only to the users selected by the conversation administrator; however, they are visible to anyone.
